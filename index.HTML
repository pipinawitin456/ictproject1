    <h1>Information and Communication Technology</h1>
    <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit, understand and manipulate information.<br>ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisual and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning. ICT also includes analog TECHNOLOGY, such as paper communication, and any mode that transmits communication.</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Technology is the sum of any techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Every technological system makes use of seven types of resources: people, information, materials, tools and machines, energy, capital and time. Since there is limited amount of certain resources on the earth, we must use these resources wisely.</p>
