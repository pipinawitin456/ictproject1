            <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
            <h3>The Motherboard and Expansion Cards</h3>
            <p>The Motherboard and Expansion Card In general-purpose computers and other expandable systems, the motherboard is the main printed circuit board. In addition to holding and allowing communication between many of a system's critical electronic components, such as the central processor unit and memory, it also serves as a connector for other peripheral devices.<br>In computing, an expansion card is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical socket, or expansion slot, on a computer motherboard, backplane, or riser card to add capability to a computer system via the expansion bus.</p>
            <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
            <h3>Computer Operating System and System Design</h3>
            <p>Computer Operating System and System Design An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Time-sharing operating systems plan tasks to make the most of the system's resources, and they may also contain accounting software to track the cost of processing time, storage, printing, and other resources. Although application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware for hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation. Operating systems can be found on a wide range of computer-based devices, including cell phones, video game consoles, and web servers and super computers.Microsoft Windows is the most popular general-purpose desktop operating system, with a market share of roughly 76.45%. Apple Inc.'s macOS is in second position (17.72 percent), and various Linux distributions are in third place (1.73 percent ). Android's market share in the mobile industry (which includes smartphones and tablets) is expected to reach 72 percent by 2020. According to third-quarter 2016 data, Android has a market share of 87.5 percent on smartphones, with a growth rate of 10.3 percent each year, followed by Apple's iOS at 12.1 percent, with a 5.2 percent year-over-year loss in market share, and other operating systems at 0.3 percent. The server and supercomputing industries are dominated by Linux distributions. Other specialized kinds of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems) (special-purpose operating systems). Embedded and real-time systems, for example, are available for a wide range of applications. Security-oriented operating systems are also available. Low system requirements are found in some operating systems (e.g. light-weight Linux distribution). Others might have more stringent system requirements. Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with new computers (OEM-installation), while others can be run directly from media (such as a live CD) or flash memory (i.e. USB stick). The process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, interfaces, and data for a system in order to meet specific criteria is known as systems design. The application of systems theory to product development is known as systems design.</p>
            <h2>Lesson 5</h2>
            <h3>Computer Disassembly and Assembly/Install Peripheral Device</h3>
            <p>Part 1: How to Assemble a CPU Step by Step This section explains how to assemble a CPU. This process, in particular, requires extreme caution.

            <h2>Lesson 6</h2>
            <h3>POST (Power on Self Test)</h3>
            <p>A power-on self-test is a procedure carried out by firmware or software procedures after a computer or other digital electronic device has been turned on. The POST results may be displayed on a device panel, sent to an external device, or kept for retrieval by a diagnostic tool in the future.</p>
            <h2>Lesson 7</h2>
            <h3>BIOS (Basic Input Output System)</h3>
            <p>The BIOS (basic input/output system) is a program that a computer's CPU uses to start the computer after it has been turned on. It also controls data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and associated devices such the hard drive, video adapter, keyboard, mouse, and printer.<br>BIOS is software that performs hardware initialization during the boot process and provides runtime services for operating systems and programs in computers. The BIOS firmware is the first program to run when a computer is turned on, and it is pre-installed on the system board.
